# SpaceX GraphQL React Application

The goal of this project is for me to get an understanding of how GraphQL works on the backend, and how I would interact with it on the frontend.

The data being gathered and distributed in this project is from https://docs.spacexdata.com.

## Setup the project

First you'll need to clone the repository.

```
# Use SSH (if set up)...
git clone git@github.com:SeanCassiere/spacex-gql-cra-app-v1.git YOUR_FOLDER

# ...or use HTTPS and switch remotes later.
git clone https://github.com/SeanCassiere/spacex-gql-cra-app-v1.git.git YOUR_FOLDER
```

Once cloned, navigate into the folder and run the development environment.

```
# NPM
npm run dev

# Yarn
yarn run dev
```
